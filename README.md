As per Google docs [1]:

"Google Apps Script is a rapid application development platform that makes it fast and easy to create business applications that integrate with G Suite. You write code in JavaScript and have access to built-in libraries for favorite G Suite applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and more. There's nothing to install—we give you a code editor right in your browser, and your scripts run on Google's servers.

If you're new to JavaScript, Codecademy offers a number of JavaScript courses. (Note that these courses were not developed by and are not associated with Google.)

What can Apps Script do?
Apps Script is versatile. Among other things, you can:

Add custom menus, dialogs, and sidebars to Google Docs, Sheets, and Forms.
Write custom functions and macros for Google Sheets.
